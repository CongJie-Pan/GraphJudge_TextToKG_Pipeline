"""
Evaluation metrics implementations for graph quality assessment.

This package contains modular implementations of various graph evaluation metrics:
- exact_matching: Triple and graph matching metrics
- text_similarity: G-BLEU and G-ROUGE implementations
- semantic_similarity: G-BertScore implementation
- structural_distance: Graph Edit Distance implementation

All metrics are adapted from graph_evaluation/metrics/eval.py for use
in the streamlit_pipeline evaluation system.
