"""
Comprehensive unit tests for GraphJudge module.

This test suite validates the simplified graph judge implementation that
provides graph triple validation using Perplexity API with binary judgments
and explainable reasoning capabilities.

Test Categories:
1. Basic functionality tests (successful judgments)
2. Error handling tests (API failures, malformed responses)
3. Response parsing tests (binary and explainable responses)
4. Explainable reasoning tests (detailed judgments)
5. Edge cases and boundary conditions
6. Integration tests with API client

Following TDD principles per docs/Testing_Demands.md.
